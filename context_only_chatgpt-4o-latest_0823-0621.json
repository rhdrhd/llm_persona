Roll the dough into small balls (about 1 inch in diameter) and place them on an ungreased baking sheet.\n4. Use a fork to press down on each ball of dough, creating a crisscross pattern.\n5. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set and slightly golden. The centers may look a bit soft, but they\u2019ll firm up as they cool.\n6. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nEnjoy your baking! Let me know if you try them out!",
